### Notes on solution code

Please be aware that this solution code represents way, way more than anyone
could be expected to produce in 3 hours. This is intended as a reference
material, with all the bonuses included, fairly strict separation of concerns,
and tons of comments.

This solution code only utilizes Android components/libraries covered so
far in class. That means no RxJava or Dagger2 in this code, as those are
advanced concepts that would likely obscure the concepts this assessment
is testing.
